# Intro scene

Network data arises frequently in applications.
The simplest networks are undirected, unweighted graphs.
In order to perform topological analysis on such a graph, we typically assign a higher-dimensional topological space.
A common construction is the clique complex -- a simplicial complex in which the k-simplices are the subsets of (k+1) vertices which are all connected.
In this image, we fill in each triangle with a 2-simplex.
From this simplicial complex, we can derive a chain complex and subsequently compute homology groups.

Network data commonly arises as a directed graph.
<!--Common examples include brain connectomes, in which some synapses pass signals exclusively in one direction, or vascular networks, in which blood flow has a net direction in each vessel.-->
In this setting, a natural analogue to the clique complex is the directed flag complex. 
A directed k-clique is a (k+1)-tuple of vertices such that all pairs of vertices in the tuple are connected by an edge, in the direction specified by the tuple.
Note, the collection of directed cliques is closed under arbitrary vertex removal.
As such, the collection of all directed cliques forms an ordered simplicial complex which can be represented by a chain complex and hence we can compute its homology.

# Defining path homology

This is a useful construction in settings where directed cliques are already distinguished motifs.
<!--For example, in a connectome, a large clique represents a reliable connection between its two end neurons, in the sense that the connection is robust to multiple edge removals.-->
In other settings, the directed flag complex might not be as relevant.
An alternative construction, defined by Grigor'yan et al, is path homology -- this construction is built on directed paths within the digraph and is not defined via a simplicial complex.

## Underlying groups

Instead, given a digraph, we say an elementary path is any sequence of vertices.
Then an allowed path is a sequence of vertices such that subsequent vertices are joined by directed edges in the graph.
In this example, `abda` is allowed but `abdc` is not allowed.
We use the collections of all such paths to freely generate two different ℤ-modules, `Λ_p` and `A_p`.
We also define a boundary map, between the `Λ_p`, using the usual formula.

## Omegas and chain complex

This gives a chain complex between the ℤ-modules of elementary paths in G but not between the modules of allowed paths.
Given an allowed 2-path, its boundary might not not be a sum of allowed 1-paths.
That is, we can't traverse back up this inclusion map.
For example, in this digraph, the boundary of `abd` contains the element `ad` which is not an edge in the digraph.

To resolve this issue we define `Ω_p` to be the elements of `A_p` whose boundaries can traverse back up the inclusion map.
It is quick to check that the boundary of an element in `Ω_p` not only includes into `A_{p-1}` but also `Ω_{p-1}`.
Therefore, we get a new chain complex, which now incorporates information about the directed paths in the digraph.
Note that the chain groups `Ω_p` are not necessarily freely generated by a subset of the allowed p-paths.
The homology of this chain complex is called the non-regular path homology.

## Random graphs

In order to apply this method and interpret the path homology of a given directed graph it is necessary to understand what path homology one might usually expect.
To answer this question we required a random graph model.
In this project, we focus on arguably the simplest random graph model, in which
