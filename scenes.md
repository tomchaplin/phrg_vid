# Scenes

## Directed Graphs and TDA

* Graph data appears often and we want to assign a high-dimensional topological object to the graph in order to use TDA -> clique complex
* Graphs often come with natural direction on the graph, how do we assign now? How do we symmetrise?
* Ideally want to be sensitive to asymmetry -> dflag complex

## Intro to Path Homology

* Path homology skips a topological object and goes straight to a chain complex using directed paths
* Define path homology
* Generators of Omega_2

## Random Graphs

* When it comes to application how do we know what Betti numbers to expect?
* Simplest model is Erdos-Renyi so we start here
* Low density vanishing is the usual story
* High density vanishing is more complicated

## Applications

* Vascular networks?
